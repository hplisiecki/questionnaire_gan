# Questionnaire Gan

This repository houses the code that can be used to train a Generative Adversarial Network to simulate survey responses. 
The aim of this project was to design a novel way of detecting fake data in online questionnaires. By training the generator
to simulate artificial survey responses, and then overtraining the discriminator a data independent online fake response 
detector can be achieved
